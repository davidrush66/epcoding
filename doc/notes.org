** Reorder secondary codes
   They should be generally in numeric order, but can also have some
   logical order.  It makes no sense to put the A line code in first,
   even though it comes numerically before the others.
** Write help texts
** DONE Put Settings in?
   - verbosity setting for coding summary
   - coding analysis warning levels?
   - ? toggle coding analysis
** DONE Bugs
   - rotation of screen loses check marks

** Errors and warnings
   - do not report 2D and 3D mapping together
   - 2D mapping and AV node ablation may not be allowed
   - Note clear if temp V pacer and AV node ablation can be billed
     together
   - Warm if no secondary codes chosen (unlikely AFB ablation done
     with mapping, eg.)
   - Warn if EP testing without arrhythmia induction coded
   - Disallow 93619 and 93620 together
   - Possibly do check for forbidden combinations in AllCodes
     (e.g. SVT ablation + additional AFB ablation)
   - No 76000 with any other device code
   - For removal and replacement of PPM and leads uses 33233 with
     33234 or 33235 and 33206-33208
   - Don't use 33206-33208 with 33227-33229
   - Don't use 33214 with 33227-33229
** Verbosity
*** Brief
    - Errors
      - 93609 & 93613
      - 93619 & 93620
      - All Addon codes
      - 93414 & 93621
    - Warnings
      - No secondary codes
      - No primary codes
      - ? No mapping codes
*** Verbose
    - Errors
      - 93619 & 93620: do not combine 2D and 3D mapping
      - All Addon codes: you must have some non-addon codes to use
        addon codes
    - Warnings
      - No secondary codes: you may be missing some secondary codes
      - No mapping codes: most ablation procedures include mapping
** Mechanics
   - Forbidden codes sets 
     e.g. { 93619, 93620 }
   - make string sets of all codes, primary, and secondary codes
   - check for no primary and no secondary
   - check if all codes set contains any forbidden set
** Symbols
   - Error: ⚠ u26A0 (or use this as warning with X as error) or Ⓧ u24cd
   - NO errors: ☺ u263a
   - Warning: ? or ?? or X or ⚠ u26A0  Ⓧ
* Help notes
** Purpose
   - Only EP!!
   - Allow easy look-up of commonly used codes
   - Define common coding scenarios
   - Demonstrate which codes cannot be combined
   - Help with code entry by physician in EHR such as EPIC
   - Meant to help the EP physician do what is required by EHR
** Excluded
   - Office codes
   - Surgical codes
   - Device interrogation/follow-up codes
   - Modifiers
   - Code components
* Limitations
  - Code descriptions are paraphrased
  - All information freely available on web
  - Not for trained coders
  - Physician and coder must still be familiar with components and
    document properly and completely
