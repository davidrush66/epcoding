** Reorder secondary codes
   They should be generally in numeric order, but can also have some
   logical order.  It makes no sense to put the A line code in first,
   even though it comes numerically before the others.
** Write help texts
** DONE Put Settings in?
   - verbosity setting for coding summary
   - coding analysis warning levels?
   - ? toggle coding analysis
** DONE Bugs
   - rotation of screen loses check marks

** Errors and warnings
   - do not report 2D and 3D mapping together
   - 2D mapping and AV node ablation may not be allowed
   - Note clear if temp V pacer and AV node ablation can be billed
     together
   - Warm if no secondary codes chosen (unlikely AFB ablation done
     with mapping, eg.)
   - Warn if EP testing without arrhythmia induction coded
   - Disallow 93619 and 93620 together
   - Possibly do check for forbidden combinations in AllCodes
     (e.g. SVT ablation + additional AFB ablation)
   - No 76000 with any other device code
   - For removal and replacement of PPM and leads uses 33233 with
     33234 or 33235 and 33206-33208
   - Don't use 33206-33208 with 33227-33229
   - Don't use 33214 with 33227-33229
** Verbosity
*** Brief
    - Errors
      - 93609 & 93613
      - 93619 & 93620
      - All Addon codes
      - 93414 & 93621
    - Warnings
      - No secondary codes
      - No primary codes
      - ? No mapping codes with ablation codes
*** Verbose
    - Errors
      - 93619 & 93620: do not combine 2D and 3D mapping
      - All Addon codes: you must have some non-addon codes to use
        addon codes
    - Warnings
      - No secondary codes: you may be missing some secondary codes
      - No mapping codes: most ablation procedures include mapping
* Help notes
** Purpose
   - Only EP!!
   - Allow easy look-up of commonly used codes
   - Define common coding scenarios
   - Demonstrate which codes cannot be combined
   - Help with code entry by physician in EHR such as EPIC
   - Meant to help the EP physician do what is required by EHR
** Excluded
   - Office codes
   - Surgical codes
   - Device interrogation/follow-up codes
   - Modifiers
   - Code components
* Limitations
  - Code descriptions are paraphrased
  - All information freely available on web
  - Not for trained coders
  - Physician and coder must still be familiar with components and
    document properly and completely
* More buttons
** Generator change
   - PPM
     - A lead
     - V lead
     - dual chamber
     - CRT
** Possible buttons
   |--------+--------|
   | PPM    | ICD    |
   | A lead | V lead |
   | dual   | CRT    |
   |--------+--------|
** Buttons aren't needed, we have separate PPM and ICD modules already

** Devices
*** 93640, 93641 reportable at time of device placement/replacememnt :cpt2011:
     This is DFT testing.  93640 is for external testing of leads
     with and analyzer and isn't in Codes.java.	
*** Use 76000 for fluoro of leads (e.g. Riata)			    :cpt2011:
*** Use 33224 to insert LV lead alone?				    :cpt2011:
*** Upgrade single to dual PPM 33214 includes gen removal	    :cpt2011:
*** Upgrade single to dual ICD 33241 & 33249			    :cpt2011:
*** Extraction and replacement PPM and leads
**** codes							    :cpt2011:
     33223 (remove gen) with 33234 or 33235 (remove 1 or 2 leads) and
     then 33206-33208 for new generator.  Don't use 33206-33208 with
     generator replacement codes (33227-33229)
**** 33212, 33213, 33221 single, dual, multi gen insertion only	    :cpt2011:
     don't combine insertion with 33233 for removal.  Use 33227-33229
     (replacement codes) only.
**** 33214 upgrade single to dual ppm				    :cpt2011:
     - includes removal of prior generator, with new gen and leads.
     - Don't report with 33227-33229 (replacement only)
**** Repair 33218, 33220 (single, dual lead repair)		    :cpt2011:
     - PPM or ICD leads
     - Use with generator replacements
***** TODO Add to Additional codes for generator change, upgrade
**** 33226 Repositioning of LV lead				    :cpt2011:
     ? Includes removal, insertion and/or replacement of existing generator
**** 33227-33229						    :cpt2011:
     - replacement codes
     - Don't report with 33233 (removal)
     - report with 33206-33208 (new systems) and 33234, 33235 (lead
       removal) for upgrades.
*** ICD codes
**** 33240, 33230, 33231					    :cpt2011:
     - 33240 ICD gen only with existing single lead
     - 33230 --- with existing dual leads
     - 33231 --- with existing multi leads
     - Don't report with generator change out at the same time, use
       33262-33264 (ICD gen change, single, dual, CRT)
**** 33241							    :cpt2011:
     - removal of any kind of ICD generator only
     - use with 33243 or 33244 (ICD lead removal by thoracotomy - not
       in EP Coding - or transvenously) and 33249 placement of new ICD
       with leads (single or dual) for removal and replacement of ICD
       generator and electrodes.
**** ICD generator change alone					    :cpt2011:
     - 33262 single lead generator
     - 33263 dual lead gen
     - 33264 multi lead gen
     - Don't use 33262-33264 with 33241 (i.e. don't bill removal and
       replacement)
     - Removal of lead(s) and replacement use 33244 (extraction ICD
       lead) and 33241 (remove generator) or ICD replacement
       33262-33264. (e.g. you take out a lead, and downgrade the device)
     - 33249.  Insert/ replace single, dual ICD system including leads.
     - For lead removal and replacement use 33241 with 33243 and 33249.

** EP
*** Ablation							    :cpt2013:
    - 93653-93657 (ablations) can't have EP procedure codes reported separately
    - Note this doesn't include 93650, AV node ablation
    - Don't report 93621 (LA pacing) with 93656 (afb ablation)
    - Don't use 93622 (LV pacing) with 93654 (VT ablation)
*** More ablation					     :cptchanges2013:
    - AFB ablation includes transseptal puncture (93462) and includes
      93621 (LA pacing/recording)
    - Don't report 2D and 3D mapping together
    - Don't report multiple ablation codes together
*** More						    :eplab2012:links:
    - Maybe can't bill IV drug infusion with ablation codes
    - comment mentions denials for 93650 (AVN ablation) and 93609 (2D
      mapping), but says nothing in the "book" indicates it is not
      allowed.  Note on Internet several have asked this question and
      no definitive answer.  Needs to be a WARNING.
    - Note that it appears that other EP procedures may be billable
      with AV node ablation, even His bundle recording.  Needs to be
      a WARNING
*** But							     :cptchanges2013:
    - Latest 2014 parentheticals OK to bill IV drug infusion with
      ablation codes

** General Help
*** Surgical codes not included (e.g. epicardial electrodes 33202)
*** We paraphrase code descriptions
**** e.g. use CRT system instead of "multi-lead" system
*** Sources are published on web, seminars, will be on web site
*** Most of the rules are enforced in the module interface, some in code analysis
*** Older/Obsolete/little used codes are not included
